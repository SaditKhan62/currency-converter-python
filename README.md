# Currency Converter (Python)

This is a simple command-line currency converter built in Python. It was created as part of my final project for CIS2300 – Programming and Computational Thinking.

## 🔧 What it Does
- Lets users convert between:
  - USD to EUR
  - GBP to INR
  - JPY to USD
  - EUR to GBP
- Uses functions and a class to keep everything clean and reusable.
- Runs in any Python 3 environment or on OneCompiler.

## 🏁 How to Run
1. Clone this repo or copy the `khan_currency.py` file.
2. Run it using Python 3:
   ```bash
   python khan_currency.py
